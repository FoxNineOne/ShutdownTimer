# Simple Shutdown Timer Script #

This is for Windows only. Maybe curiosity will lead me to try other OSs.

Save the script as a bat file, then run the bat file in Command Prompt, or double click the file to run.
You will be presented with the following six options. 

1 - 30 minutes (0.5 hour)
2 - 60 minutes (1 hour)
3 - 90 minutes (1.5 hour)
4 - 120 minutes (2 hours)
5 - Custom Timer (in minutes)

0 - Exit (turn around, we never met)


Upon entering options 1-4, the shutdown timer will go into effect. 
Option 5 will ask you for a customer timer


All of this is self explanatory, I hope this ReadMe is never needed.

Listen to Zorro Sombre instrumentals.
